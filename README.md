# Ibtida 🕌

Ibtida is a **native iOS application** built with SwiftUI that encourages consistent prayer, intentional worship, and charitable giving. The app allows users to track daily prayers, build streaks, earn credits, and convert those credits into donations for verified non-profit organizations — all within a calm, minimal, faith-focused experience.

## 🌟 Purpose

Ibtida (meaning *“a beginning”*) exists to bring together two essential acts of worship:
- **Prayer (Salah)** — through consistency and awareness
- **Charity (Sadaqah)** — through accessible, transparent giving

By combining prayer tracking with a credit-based donation system, Ibtida helps users turn intention into action and build meaningful spiritual habits from the ground up.
